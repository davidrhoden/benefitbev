I have been in the Employee Benefits Industry for 23 years.  I have experience in all areas of the business including time with a Human Resources department, as a Marketing Assistant, an Office Manager and since 2003 as a Benefits Counselor.

After graduating from University of Tennessee, Knoxville with my undergraduate degree, I worked in Knoxville and Nashville before spending a few years in Western Maryland.  I moved back to my hometown of Chattanooga, Tennessee in 2008 and joined Unum Enroll as a Home Office based Enrollment Coordinator.  There I excelled in training field office enrollers and assisting the field office Enrollment Managers.  I planned and directed many complex enrollment events along with Brokers and Field Offices.

After a brief time managing a church office full time and enrolling part time, I joined fellow Unum alum Michael Stalvey in running Boar Enrollment Strategies. I continue to work with Michael for our group clients and I am available to individuals for personal coverage. Please call me if you have questions about Medicare Advantage, Medicare Supplements or Life Insurance.
